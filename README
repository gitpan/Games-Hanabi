Games-Hanabi version 0.01
=========================

Hanabi is a card game in which players take turns playing cards
in 5 suits, sequentially from 1 to 5.  The catch is that players
can only see each others' hands, and not their own.
They must give hints to each in order to succceed.

This distribution implements the rules for the game (no variations).
